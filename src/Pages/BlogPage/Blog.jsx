        <p className="text-secondary">
          An access token is an object that describes the security context of a
          process or thread. A token is used to make security decisions and
          store tamper-proof information about some system entity. While a token
          is generally used to represent only security information, it can hold
          additional free-form data attached while the token is created.

        <p className="text-secondary">
          The refresh token is used to authenticate the user after the initial
          access token has expired

        <p className="tex-secondary">
          When user stays on the page for quite long time without interaction,
          'access token' expires. Then user performs some action and API
          responds with 401. Usually, there is a 'refresh token' which is kept
          on the client. And after having 401 as response, UI should refresh the
          'access token' using the 'refresh token'. If there is no 'refresh
          token', then UI can simply re-authenticate user and obtain fresh
          'access token

          What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work ?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-secondary">
          When working with data in MongoDB, you may quickly have to run complex
          operations, with multiple stages of operations to gather metrics for
          your project. Generating reports and displaying useful metadata are
          just two major use cases where MongoDB aggregation operations can
          prove incredibly useful, powerful, and flexible. <br />
          When you need to do more complex aggregation, you can use the MongoDB
          aggregation pipeline (hereâ€™s a more detailed tutorial). Aggregation
          pipelines are collections of stages that, combined with the MongoDB
          query syntax, will allow you to obtain an aggregated result.
